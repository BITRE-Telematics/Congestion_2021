Note: Ratio of median travel time to best (shortest) travel time for each route.</div>
<p>The figure below shows all 22 selected Sydney freight vehicle routes and an index of the median excess travel time ratio (METR) – i.e. the ratio of median travel time to best (shortest) travel time – across each route.</p>
<p>The figure below shows changes in the METRs and MEURs between 2020 and 2021 across each of the 22 selected Sydney freight vehicle routes. Whilst the city-wide measure rose many routes experienced declines, which may be the result of differing lockdown conditions across the city.</p>
<p>Decreases in travel time uncertainty rose on average but inconsistently. Large decreases on the M1 (North) are an artifact of the data process.</p>
<p>Many Sydney routes showed improvements in both measures during the third quarter of 2020 when there were renewed lockdowns.</p>

<p>This route follows the M4 tunnel from the former terminus of the M4 Motorway at Strathfield to Ashfield and then the A4 (also known as the City West Link) to the Cahill Expressway near the Sydney CBD. It extends the M4 route with roads that were not built in 2019 and has been included as a separate route so data remains consistent.</p>
