<p>The figure below shows all 9 selected Adelaide freight vehicle routes and an index of the METR across each route.</p>
<p>The figure below shows changes in the METRs and MEURs across each of the 9 selected Adelaide freight vehicle routes. Adelaide was alone amongst the 5 capital cities in showing a decrease in mean excess travel time between 2020 and 2021, but showed no distinct pattern across routes with several, including the highly weighted A2-M2, showing both an increase and decrease depending on travel direction.</p>
<p>Changes in travel time uncertainty showed fairly consistent falls with changes in the city wide measure driven by the A2-M2.</p>
