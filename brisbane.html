<p>The figure below shows all 10 selected Brisbane freight vehicle routes and an index of the METR across each route.</p>
<p>The figure below shows changes in the METRs and MEURs across each of the 10 selected Brisbane freight vehicle routes. A majority of routes in Brisbane experienced increases in travel time congestion in 2021. In particular, the highly-weighted M1 experienced increases in both directions reversing reductions observed in 2020.</p>
<p>There was fairly consistent increases in congestion uncertainty (MEUR) although increases in the city wide measure were increased largely by the highly weighted M1.</p>
