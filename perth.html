Note: Ratio of median travel time to best (shortest) travel time for each route.</div>
<p>The figure below shows all 10 selected freight vehicle routes in Perth and an index of the METR across each route.</p>
<p>The figure below shows changes in the METRs and MEURs between 2020 and 2021 across each of the 10 selected Perth freight vehicle routes. Mean excess travel time congestion in Perth generally increased although this was inconsistent between and within routes.</p>
<p>Likewise uncertainty congestion generally increased but was inconsistent across routes, although increases on the relatively higher-weighted Routes 2 and 3 (Roe) were enough to drive an increase in the city wide measure. The low-weighted Route 5 showed an anomalously large increase in congestion likely due to artefacts of the data processing.</p>
