<p>The figure below shows all 19 selected Melbourne freight vehicle routes and an index of the METR across each route.</p>
<p>The figure below shows changes in the METRs and MEURs across each of the 19 selected Melbourne freight vehicle routes. Travel time congestion increased across almost most routes but particularly on surface routes in Northern Melbourne. Motorway routes were more stable despite large reductions in 2020.</p>
<p>Unlike in Sydney, increases in mean excess uncertainty was fairly systematic. It was also noticeable on both freeway and surface routes.</p>
<p>Whilst less pronounced than in Sydney, renewed lockdowns in the third quarter of 2020 saw improvements in congestion across many routes.</p>
